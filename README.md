## Azure MVAD Guides

A repository with extensive guides on how to use Azure's Multivariate Time-Series Anomaly Detector service. There is also a `data` folder, containing the time-series data used for the purposes of the examples presented in the Notebooks.

**IMPORTANT**: These notebooks are supposed to be run in a Databricks environment (hence the corresponding secrets widget). Connections are also established with other Azure components, such as the Azure Storage Service.
